Hi, welcome to Yggdrasil!

I’m Amor, and this is a space where I showcase my journey, projects, and understanding of things.

Yggdrasil isn’t just a collection of my work—it serves as a codex, a record of how I perceive and make sense of my Abilities/Skills.

It’s also a way for me to store and refine my knowledge over time.

In this portfolio, you’ll find a mix of my creative and technical endeavors, all shaped by my curiosity and desire to learn.

Feel free to explore and get a glimpse of what I’ve been working on!
